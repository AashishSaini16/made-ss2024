# Analysing the daily flow and storage of Gas in France

In recent times, the importance of analysing and monitoring the usage of energy resources has increased significantly, especially when it comes to the sustainable and reliable energy systems. Understanding the analysis and monitoring the daily flows and storage is crucial for optimizing management, enhancing the supply security and making informed decisions as well. This project uses the highly trusted data available by the France government about their daily flow and storage of gas. The primary objective of this project is to make a comprehensive analysis on the flow pattern as looking in those insights will surely help in understanding the approach of managing the gas resources, planning for future demands and enhancing the overall energy strategy of the country.
